This tutorial might be helpful: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-perform-object-detection-with-yolov3-in-keras/ You’ll need to take this tutorial and then fit it to a generic object detection context. The tensorflow docs may be helpful as well: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection Please report your metrics for the test set. You should make use of these metrics: https://github.com/rafaelpadilla/Object-Detection-Metrics here is an implementation: https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP\n",
    "    Next make use of Mask R-CNN to do object detection. Please follow this tutorial: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-train-an-object-detection-model-with-keras/ remember again, you’ll need to generalize to finding any object. Please report out your metrics as you did before.\n",
    "    Compare and contrast YOLO and Mask R-CNN, which did better? How did you decide that? Does one model or the other do better on different kinds of labels? If so, why do you think?\n",
